# Introduction to React.js

`React.js` (commonly known as React) is a popular open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UI), particularly for single-page applications (SPAs). It was `developed by Facebook` and is used for building dynamic, responsive, and reusable UI components.

React makes it easy to build complex UIs by breaking them down into smaller, isolated components that can be managed independently. These components can then be combined to form the overall application UI.

## Key Features of React:
- `Component-Based Architecture:` React lets you build encapsulated components that manage their own state and can be composed to build complex UIs.
- `Declarative Syntax:` React's declarative approach makes it easier to design interactive UIs by describing how the UI should look for any given state.
- `Virtual DOM:` React uses a virtual DOM to optimize rendering performance by only updating the parts of the UI that have changed.
- `Unidirectional Data Flow:` React enforces a one-way data flow, making it easier to manage state and props.

## Steps to Get Started with React.js

Follow these steps to create your first React application.

1. Pre-Requisites 

    Before getting started with React, make sure you have the following installed:
    - **Node.js**: React requires Node.js to run. You can download and install it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

        ![Node.js Download Interface](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*2ScjPOP6RVdmYPEJ_yV-Lw.jpeg)

    - **npm or yarn**: npm (Node Package Manager) comes with Node.js, or you can use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as an alternative.

    You can check if Node.js and npm are installed by running the following commands in your terminal:
    ```bash
    node -v
    npm -v
    ```

2. Installing Create React App

    The easiest way to get started with React is by using Create React App (CRA), a tool that sets up a React project with sensible defaults.

    To install CRA globally, run the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    npm install -g create-react-app
    ```
3. Creating a New React Project

    Now create a new React application using Create React App:

    ```bash
    npx create-react-app my-first-app
    ```
    This command creates a new directory named **my-first-app** with all the necessary files and dependencies to start working with React.

    Change into the project directory: 
    ```bash
    cd my-first-app
    ```
4. Running Your React App

    To run your React app, use the following command:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    If you used Yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```
    This will launch the React development server and open your app in the default browser at http://localhost:3000/. You'll see the default React welcome page.

5. Understanding the Project Structure

    Once you've set up your React project, you will notice the following directory structure:

    ```gql
    my-first-app/
    ├── node_modules/    # Project dependencies
    ├── public/
    │   ├── index.html   # The main HTML file
    ├── src/
    │   ├── App.js       # Main React component
    │   └── index.js     # Entry point for the React app
    ├── package.json     # Project metadata and dependencies

    ```
    Key files to know:

    `public/index.html:` The base HTML file where React will render your app.

    `src/index.js:` The entry point of the app, where React is initialized.

    `src/App.js:` The main component of your app.

6. Modifying Your First Component

    Open `src/App.js` and you’ll see the default React component code. You can modify it as follows:

    ```js
    import React from 'react';
    import './App.css';

    function App() {
    return (
        <div className="App">
        <h1>Hello, React!</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my first React application!</p>
        </div>
    );
    }
    export default App;
    ```
    Now, save the file, and the browser will automatically reload with your changes.

7. Using Components in React

    React applications are built using components. Components are the building blocks of your UI. You can create new components by defining them in separate files.

    For example, create a new component in `src/components/Welcome.js`:

    ```js
    import React from 'react';

    function Welcome() {
      return <h2>Welcome to React Development!</h2>;
    }

    export default Welcome;
    ```
    Now, import and use this component inside `App.js`:

    ```js
    import React from 'react';
    import './App.css';
    import Welcome from './components/Welcome';

    function App() {
    return (
        <div className="App">
        <h1>Hello, React!</h1>
        <Welcome />
        </div>
    );
    }

    export default App;
    ```
    This modularity allows you to manage your app's UI more effectively.

8. Understanding State and Props
State:
State is used to store data that can change over time in your app. It is mutable and is typically handled by individual components.

    Example:

    ```js
    import React, { useState } from 'react';

    function Counter() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    return (
        <div>
        <p>Count: {count}</p>
        <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</ button>
        </div>
    );
    }

    export default Counter;
    ```
    `Props:` Props are immutable and allow you to pass data from a parent component to a child component.

    - Example:

    ```js
    function Greeting(props) {
     return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
    }

    function App() {
    return (
        <div>
        <Greeting name="John" />
        </div>
    );
    }
    ```
9. Building and Deploying Your React App

    Once you're ready to deploy your React app, use the following command to create a production-ready build:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This creates a build/ directory with all the optimized files. You can then deploy it to any static file hosting service like:
    - Netlify

    - Vercel

    - GitHub Pages
